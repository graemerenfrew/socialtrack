# Hello. This is Nick from the future (March 2019 to be exact). An emergency
# addition had to be made below to fix an issue related to a recent version of
# werkzeug. This library was not version locked in this file.
#
# The line below isn't covered on video, but it locks werkzeug to the latest
# version that works with this course's code base. A future update video will
# cover upgrading this package and more.
